Marcellus takes that lesson, and while the happy little whore kisses him on the cheek afterwards and calls him \"shy\" that is more than I would have expected from Marcella. \n\nHer body -that I am using now- has to remain virginal until marriage, of course.

Women...\" -he whispers into my ear- \"... -HUMAN women, that is- have something called a 'hymen'. It is also called 'maidenhood' and mistaken as proof that the woman did not have sexual intercourse.
